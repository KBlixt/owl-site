            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like
                beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers,
                a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc
                can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances
                onto the owls' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of
                prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic
                nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense
                of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Although
                owls have binocular vision, their large eyes are fixed in their
                sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their
                entire heads to change views. As owls are farsighted, they are
                unable to clearly see anything within a few centimeters of their
                eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of
                filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as
                "feelers". Their far vision, particularly in low light, is
                exceptionally good.

                Owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270°. Owls have
                14 neck vertebrae compared to seven in humans, which makes their
                necks more flexible. They also have adaptations to their
                circulatory systems, permitting rotation without cutting off
                blood to the brain: the foramina in their vertebrae through which
                the vertebral arteries pass are about 10 times the diameter of
                the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery as in
                humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae
                higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and
                the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or
                junction, the largest of any bird's, preventing blood supply
                from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other
                anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support
                this effect.
